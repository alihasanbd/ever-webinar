A simple implementation of EverWebinar API for custom form integration with JIT schedule. </br>
If you need help in implementation, please ping me at [Upwork.com](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01ec409f2f24939399) or [Freelancer.com](https://www.freelancer.com/u/AliHasanBD) </br>
I'll charge only **$100** or **$50** if you already have the registration form designed.
